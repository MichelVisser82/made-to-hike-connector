# MadeToHike Website - Picture-Focused Improvements

## Overview
Transformed the entire website to be picture-focused using database-driven images instead of dummy placeholder images.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Replaced All Dummy Images with SmartImage Components
- **LandingPage.tsx**: Hero background and region showcase now use SmartImage
- **SearchPage.tsx**: Tour cards and guide avatars use SmartImage with contextual tags
- **TourDetailPage.tsx**: Hero image and guide portraits use SmartImage
- All images now fetch from your database based on category, usage context, and tags

### 2. Enhanced Visual Design
- **Tour Cards**: Changed from landscape (16:9) to portrait (4:5) aspect ratio for more prominent image display
- **Image Galleries**: Added featured adventures gallery with 3-image layout

- **Usage Context**: "landing", "dolomites", "scotland", "pyrenees", "avatar"
- **Tags**: ["landscape", "hiking", "portrait", "professional", "summit", etc.]
- **Fallback Support**: Original URLs as fallbacks while database populates
