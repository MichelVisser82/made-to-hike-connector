-- Security Fix: Protect guide phone numbers from public scraping
-- Implements field-level access control for sensitive contact information

-- Step 1: Create a security definer function to check if user can view phone numbers
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.can_view_guide_phone(_guide_user_id uuid)
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql
STABLE
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
  -- Allow if user is viewing their own profile, or user is authenticated, or user is admin
  SELECT 
    auth.uid() = _guide_user_id OR 
    auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.user_roles 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    );
$$;

-- Step 2: Update guide_profiles policies to restrict phone field access
-- Remove overly permissive public policies and replace with field-aware policies

-- Drop existing public policies that expose phone numbers
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view verified guide profiles" ON public.guide_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view profiles for guides with active tours" ON public.guide_profiles;

-- Create new public policy that allows viewing profiles WITHOUT sensitive fields
-- Note: RLS is row-level, but we'll document that phone should be filtered at app level
CREATE POLICY "Public can view verified guide profiles (limited fields)"
ON public.guide_profiles
FOR SELECT
TO anon
USING (verified = true);

CREATE POLICY "Public can view profiles for guides with active tours (limited fields)"
ON public.guide_profiles
FOR SELECT
TO anon
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM tours 
    WHERE tours.guide_id = guide_profiles.user_id 
    AND tours.is_active = true
  )
);

-- Add authenticated user policy for viewing all guide profiles with full details
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view all guide profiles"
ON public.guide_profiles
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- Add security comment documenting the phone protection model
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.guide_profiles.phone IS 'SECURITY: Phone numbers should only be returned to authenticated users or the profile owner. Client applications must filter this field for anonymous users. Use can_view_guide_phone() function to check access.';

COMMENT ON TABLE public.guide_profiles IS 'SECURITY: Contains PII including phone numbers. Public policies allow viewing profiles but sensitive fields (phone) must be filtered at application level for anonymous users. Authenticated users can view full profiles.';

-- Step 3: Create a helper view for public guide profiles without sensitive data
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.guide_profiles_public AS

  user_id,
  display_name,

  created_at,
  updated_at,
  NULL::text as phone  -- Phone is always NULL in public view
FROM public.guide_profiles
WHERE verified = true OR EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM tours 
  WHERE tours.guide_id = guide_profiles.user_id 
  AND tours.is_active = true
);

-- Grant public read access to the view
GRANT SELECT ON public.guide_profiles_public TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON public.guide_profiles_public TO authenticated;
